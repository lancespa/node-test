# node-test

I went to follow directions at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Automated_testing and the gulp was significantly changed enough for the code provided in the directions not to work. I modified it so it'd work and posted the code changes here.

The code updates derived from [gulpjs.com]https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start documentation.
